## ðŸš€ More Features Coming Soon...

If you feel so inclined I am tracking features I would like to add in the Projects portion of this repo, feel free to create an issue if you have an idea. To be honest I'm not sure why you would do that but hey I'd be honored. Hell, I'm honored if you're even reading this.
