There is something so beautiful about a hello world application. It's the first step in your new jouney whether it's new language, framework, or even software development in general. Once you have gotten to the point where you print those words on the screen the possibilities are endless! So it goes without saying my excitment at the prospect of seeing those words in this blog is at mount everest levels. Finally, I too, can scream into the void. 

Prologue aside I'd really like to use this first post to outline my plans for the future. I mean I have big plans for this blog! Although implementing those plans will take time and I'm quite short on that these days. But you have my word I'll try my best to chip away at it the best I can. Along the way, I'd like to document my journey. 

Here are some features I'm exited about working on:
- fluid Image support in blog
- theme picker in blog settings
- dialog modal to change settings (like themes)
- accessiblity score checker for each page
- persist theme in local storage
