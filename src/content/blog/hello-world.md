description: There is something so beautiful about a hello world. It's your beginning. The first step in your new journey. It could be a new language, framework, or... maybe a blog. But once you've gotten to the point where you see those words on the screen the possibilities become endless! So here's mine, I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoy dreaming of the possibilities.

Hey!üòä I live in Durham, North Carolina with my girlfriend and two dogs. I enjoy art and I particularly love playing music. In addition to that I'm a collector of hobbies. My newest is woodworking, wish me luck. I suppose having a lot of hobbies is a good thing, because I also kept a hobby of following tech. Which led me to become a full time developer for a tech consulting company. And I'm very grateful to be in that position. Having a wide array of interests seems to be a common thread with developers, we must enjoy trying new things.


So that's why you're here. This is my latest forray into something new. The plan is to make a blog post once a month along with a matching youtube style video. The content will be technical üßê, funny ü§û, and emotionally validating üíú. As a sneak peak here are some of the topics I'm currently writing:

- Building dynamic forms with Formik, NextJS, and TypeScript
- A pattern for simple accessible modals in react
- Building a multi-step form with vanilla Typescript and Vite


Ever since I started learning web development in earnest I've felt an immense gratitude to the dev community, specifically the JavaScript community. They have quite literally given me a means to create a new living for myself and the best way I can think to give back is to help others. In a perfect world my content will guide a junior dev, be a reference for a middle dev, and insightful for senior devs and managers.

I also have some more things I'd like to build on this website. Which is a great time to mention that you can find all this code open source on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/jordattebayo/jordattebayo). Some of those features are:
- An accessibility score checker for each page
- A theme picker in blog settings that persists between page refreshes
- And to make a better readme.md for the GitHub repo


Trust me you don't want to miss these gems!
