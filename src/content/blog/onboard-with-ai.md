Some time ago I was talking to my mom about AI. I had just obtained the Microsoft AI Engineer Certificate and felt an inflated sense of knowledge-ability. I felt compelled to convey my thoughts regarding AI's efficencies and shortcomings to her. At the time I thought executives were just hyping up AI and it's gains. They were pushing air to gain mental real estate in order to be at the top of the list when AI did something that could actually make money. To be clear I thought AI was amazing, particularly LLMs, I thought it was so cool to hold a conversation with a large model. I couldn't see much utility past that sense of wonder, it was a party trick. Impressive, but not something people should pay to see.

Worse yet, LLMs generation story was concerning. The sheer amount of power and energy it took to train the models brings up ethical concerns not to say the people who were exploited in passing in training data. The books ruined. And I don't think I'll even get started when it comes to people's copywritten work.

Let's just say I was a skeptic.

Fast forward a year and some change and AI still is mentioned in every engineering podcast, talk, presentation, youtube video, and blog post. Models have come incredibly far and new tools hit the internet every week. I've even shipped an entire project for my consultancy leveraging Cursor, an AI code editor. I'll come back to that.

This week I had some free time and decided to create a slack app that uses lang graph to call openai models and give it tools to use for various dev related tasks, an agent. There was a learning curve to learning langchain's framework, and a curve for learning how to understand models vs how I understood them last year.

There's no shortage of content on how to learn more about AI, tooling, and agent creation. A lot of the content contridicts itself, it feels kinda funny to listen to one podcast say "agents have too many gaurdrails, just give them plenty of tokens and let it rip" and then listen to another and hear "agents need guardrails to be effective".

Going back to me punishing my mother telling her everything I thought about AI. She brought up an anecdote about personal computers when she was growing up and how her mother refused to pick them up.

I wonder if it was as annoying to devs then as the AI-hype cycle is to us now...

She then went on to say that there were plenty of people who thought, no computer is going to replace this system I have now. If I need seomthing I go to a file cabinet and retrieve it. I don't need to worry about memory, pulling up the correct program, then printing it. It's already printed!

A lot of people probably went the rest of their careers not using PCs. They were probably able to retire or find a place in their orgs where they didn't need a PC. But a lot of people also adopted early, they had the advantage of getting a headstart learning the new world. And as PCs became more user friendly and less cumbersome those people found that the tools were enahncing the producivity.

Sorry for the back and forth but going back to my experience using Cursor. It was incredible. It wrote functions I knew I wanted to write but would have had to think for minutes on how to create. It implemented application level architecture across multiple files effortlessly, sometimes even one-shotting my half baked prompts.

I can't imagine going without it at this point, I moved maybe 20-30% faster than I normally could have. I even felt the need to use the IDE for personal projects.

Hearing that anecdote reasonated with me. AI at this point isn't going to replace anyone, but it is a new tool that changes the way we interact with authoring code. It moves faster than we can.

There are a lot of difficulties it poses but this is the new normal so we may as well embrace our new workflow because there's no putting it back in the bottle. I see it now. I'm on board.
