Wow, how incredible is it to be able to put your thoughts out into the world? Writing thisâ€”my very first journal entryâ€”gives me the same elatement I felt when I created my first HTML page. There's a sense of wonder in seeing text that is marked up with special characters and tags, transform into something visually organized and beautiful in the browser. And itâ€™s not just on my machineâ€”it can be shared almost instantaneously with people around the world. A document available to anyone curious enough to request it. Thatâ€™s exactly what this is: a letter to the world.

Iâ€™ll keep it brief. My plans for this journal arenâ€™t to share my deepest, darkest secrets for anyone to stumble upon. Sorry if youâ€™re the type who enjoys snooping through peopleâ€™s drawers! Instead, this is where Iâ€™ll post my more random and unfiltered thoughts. Expect musings on the anime Iâ€™m watching, the games Iâ€™m playing, the books Iâ€™m reading, or the things Iâ€™m creating. On that note, thanks for stopping by.
